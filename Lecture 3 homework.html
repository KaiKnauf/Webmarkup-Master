	<p> 
		Pirates of the Carribean is one of my favorite movie series ever. The characters fit perfectly with the story,
		especially 
			<q> 
				Jack Sparrow 
			</q> 
		by Johnny Depp. These are some of my favorite lines from him:
	</p>
	
	<blockquote cite = "https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/jack-sparrow-quotes/#.jb28i0dfo">
		<ul>
			<li> <q> This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow </q> </li>
			<li> <q> My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are in trouble </q> </li>
			<li> <q> I regret nothing ever </q> </li>
			<li> <q> Did no one come to save me just because they missed me? </q> </li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>

	</p>
	
	<p> 
		The &#60;var&#62; tage shows a variable:
			<var> 
				Variable

	</p>
	
	<p> The same effect is shown with the &#60;dfn&#62; tag:
		<dfn> Defining instance </dfn>
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		Using the &#60;dt&#62;, &#60;dt&#62; and &#60;dd&#62; tags you can create a definition list: 
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt> Fortnite </dt>
